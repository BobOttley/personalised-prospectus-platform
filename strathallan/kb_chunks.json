As a result, our pupils are confident, eager to try new things, polite and well mannered. We listen to them and ensure that they’re happy and well looked after every day.\n\nIn Riley, we focus on creating a safe and stimulating environment where children can learn, have fun and enjoy spending their time.

There's Chapel on Wednesday mornings and Assembly on Fridays, with the first lessons starting at 8.40am.\n\nAt morning break many pupils return back to their houses for their daily dose of tea and toast. Each day pupil has a room in their house which they share with another day pupil. This is a quiet study space and handy for storing their books and equipment.\n\nThere are six lessons in total before lunch then either afternoon lessons until 4.10pm or games and activities. We also have Saturday morning school until 12.20pm followed by school sports fixtures. Day pupils can leave once their sports commitments are completed on a Saturday afternoon, but many choose to stay on and socialise with their friends.\n\nAfter school is finished at 4.10pm, pupils have some free time back in their house before dinner, which is served in the main dining room at 5.45pm to 6.30pm.\n\nMany pupils choose to then visit their friends in other boarding houses and socialise in the common rooms before prep at 7.30pm to 9pm. This takes place in pupils' individual boarding houses and staff are on hand should pupils require help with their homework.\n\nAt the weekend each boarding house has their own activities they like to do for fun in the evenings. These include movie marathons, cooking group meals, ordering in take away and board games. We also organise social events or 'reels nights' for each year group, with day pupils often staying overnight in the boarding houses afterwards.",

Story Explorers takes young readers on a storytelling adventure designed to capture the imagination and spark a lifelong love of literature.\n\nA Very Special Christmas Session\n\nIn our first session for the 2025-26 academic year, we are inviting explorers aged 0-6 to join us in a uniquely festive event, adventuring through The Nicht Afore Christmas. This is a beautiful Scots language translation of the classic Christmas poem, and we are delighted to be joined by the original translator, Irene McFarlane, for a live reading session bringing this classic tale life – in Scots – for the youngest of readers.\n\nThis event, brought to life with the kind support of Tippermuir Books, is a celebration not only of Christmas magic, but of local language, culture and community heritage.\n\nYour Story Explorer will enjoy: - Elf-led crafts and storytelling activities - Hot chocolate and festive treats - A live reading from Irene - A special gift from Santa for every child\n\nThis is a joyful, immersive morning for families to share together and a beautiful introduction to the richness of Scots storytelling traditions.",
