Mrs & Mr Laird-PortchIn Woodlands, we support and encourage each other to grow as confident and responsible young women. Be brave: we get involved and try new things. There is a vast amount on offer at Strathallan and as a house we champion our huge breadth of skills and interests from photograph and stage management to the pipe band, netball and cross country.Be honest: we are all work in progress and sometimes it is hard to take the better path. But being honest is, in the long run much easier and allows trust and understanding to be built across the house.Be kind: Woodlands is a big family, and we all benefit from the support of each other. Our individual differences give light and energy to the house, providing opportunities for us to learn from each other in so many ways..
