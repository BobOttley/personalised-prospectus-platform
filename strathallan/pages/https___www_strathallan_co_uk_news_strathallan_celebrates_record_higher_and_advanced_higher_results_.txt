Results published today by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) show that at Strathallan, A grades at Higher and Advanced Higher have more than doubled since 2019, the best results yet.Lower Sixth achieved an impressive 92% pass rate at Higher, with 100% A’s obtained in Drama, Economics, French, Music, Latin and Spanish.Our Upper Sixth also attained outstanding results with 93% accepted to their first choice of destination, including the Universities of Bath, Edinburgh, Durham, St Andrews, Glasgow, Manchester, Stirling and the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance in London.Headmaster of Strathallan School, Mark Lauder, expressed his heartfelt congratulations to this year's cohort for their impressive achievements. He stated, "These tremendous results are a testament to the dedication and hard work of our pupils, who should all feel immensely proud of what they have achieved. We are especially pleased to note that we have a record number of pupils with 5 As or better, demonstrating the exceptional calibre of our students and the value of our holistic, individually focused teaching approach.“While Strathallan is about much more than just grades, grades matter, and I am delighted to see continuous improvement year-on year. In 2020, we became the first Scottish Boarding School to introduce a one-year full Higher programme alongside our existing two-year Higher programme and A Level courses and the results speak for themselves. I am incredibly proud of our pupils and staff for all their hard work again this year.”One of the pupils delighted with her results today is the incoming Vice-Captain of School, Annabel A who achieved 5 A’s in French, Geography, History, English and Drama. “I am really happy with my results,” said Annabel. “All my hard work has paid off and now, I will start considering all my options.” Another student celebrating stellar results today is Anni W, who told us how relieved she was to receive her text from SQA this morning which revealed her 5 A’s in English, Spanish, Latin, Human Biology and Modern Studies.Aiming to study Biological Sciences at University, Anni said, “Getting the results I wanted is like a weight off my shoulders. Next year, I'm diving into my Advanced Highers and taking on the challenge of an additional Higher in Chemistry. Today feels like the pressure has been lifted and now I can focus on next year.”Confirming her place at her first choice of university, Isabella A collected two A’s in Advanced Higher Chemistry and Biology today. Isabella leaves Strathallan with a string of straight A’s, five at Higher and two at Advanced Higher, heading to the University of Bath to study Pharmacy."It’s a relief to know I have secured my place at Bath. I can’t wait to get started and discover the city and campus.”--- More academic results will be announced following the publication of GCSE and A-level results later this month.
