The right place to develop your intellectual, musical, dramatic and sporting talents. Mr BatterhamIn Simpson, we look to create an environment that you look forward to returning to at the end of another busy day. We strive for balance and for every one of our boys to feel safe and appreciated. We will look to develop the sense of responsibility which you have for yourself and for others while also encouraging the development of your leadership qualities.You are asked to remember: - Try your hardest at everything. Throw yourself into all areas of school and house life; be busy and involved. You only get out of life what you put in. - Treat all the people (and all property) in the House with respect, as you would wish to be treated yourself.The most important thing is for you to be happy, to use your time here to achieve great things and to leave with lifelong memories.Find out more about Boarding Join us Take your first steps to joining the Strathallan family.
