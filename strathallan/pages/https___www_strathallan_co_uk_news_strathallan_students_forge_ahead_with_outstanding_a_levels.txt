Students leaving the Perthshire School have achieved the second best A Level results in the last decade with 70% A*-B and a third of the pupils achieving the equivalent of three A’s or better.Data published today by UCAS indicates that 85% of pupils from Strathallan have been accepted into their first choice of university, well surpassing the UK average.Headmaster of Strathallan, Mark Lauder, said, “These outstanding results are a testament to the hard work of our students and staff. These results, combined with everything else they have achieved beyond the classroom leaves me in no doubt that our Strathallians are well prepared for whatever comes next. Well done!" One Strathallan student celebrating today is Isabella Zhu, who landed A*, A*, A, A, A in Maths, Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Chinese. Confirming her place to read Medical Biosciences at Imperial College London, Isabella said she couldn’t believe her eyes when her results came through.“I was really surprised as we knew the results would be tough this year but I was relieved and excited that all my study sessions and revision had paid off.”“It feels unreal knowing that I’m heading to Imperial next month. I visited it last year and loved everything about it. I always wanted to be a doctor but after Covid hit I thought about how many people I can help. There’s a finite number of patients a doctor can help but as a scientist, I might be able to help millions.”Joining Strathallan four years ago, Isabella said studying in Scotland wasn’t what she was expecting, “The teachers have all been fantastic, they are more like friends with lots of good advice. I’ve always felt welcome and I know I’ve made lifelong friends boarding in Perthshire.”Another pupil pleased with his results today was Finn Granville-Ross who picked up his results at the beach in Kenya. Confirming his place to study Veterinary Medicine at Edinburgh University, the 18-year-old from Ayr, said he was over the moon with his results of straight A’s in Biology, Chemistry and Geography.A Music Scholar, Head of House, and Head of the Royal Marine cadets at School, Finn said earning his place at the Royal School of Veterinary Studies was a dream come true.“I’ve always wanted to be a vet since I was a kid,” Finn said. “It feels amazing to know I’ve made it in and now more hard work begins.”Meanwhile, Ukrainian pupil Khrystyna Borysova has earned herself a spot at the renowned Istituto Marangoni, less than a year after she first picked up a needle and thread.Despite offers pouring in from several fashion schools around the world, Khrystyna has accepted her place to the prestigious Fashion London School after impressing their staff with her portfolio of hand-crafted, breath-taking garments.Khrystyna was in the car traveling through Europe with her parents when she got the email confirming her place. “When I got the email I couldn’t believe it at first, it still feels like it was a dream,” said Khrystyna, “I couldn’t believe that all that hard work is finished and my dream had definitely come true. So now I’m getting ready to start the design part of my life soon.”This year's A Level results, along with record-breaking Higher and Advanced Higher achievements, highlights the School’s unwavering commitment to academic excellence.
