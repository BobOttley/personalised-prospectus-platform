In just two years, the school’s Athletic Development Programme, led by Mr Webb, has seen a 400% increase in sessions and a 300% rise in pupil participation. Designed not just for athletes but for every pupil, the programme focuses on building strength, resilience and confidence, qualities that extend far beyond sport and into all aspects of life and learning. “In a time when young people are more sedentary than ever, our programme is helping pupils move more, feel stronger, and grow in confidence,” said Mr Webb, Head of Athletic Development. “We’re seeing happier, more motivated pupils and that’s absolutely something worth investing in.”To support this momentum, Strathallan has announced that this year’s Annual Fund will prioritise the refurbishment of the school’s small gym, transforming it into a flexible, modern space accessible to all pupils, including the youngest in the Prep School. The upgraded facility will better support the school’s innovative Play & Explore and Foundation & Emerging movement curriculums, with an open-plan design that encourages inclusive participation across the school community.Aileen Wilson, Head of Development and Alumni Relations, said, “We’ve seen first-hand the positive impact this programme has had on pupils' health, wellbeing and engagement. Our Annual Fund gives parents, alumni and supporters a way to be part of that continued success, helping us shape an environment where every pupil can thrive.”The Annual Fund also supports other key projects across the school each year, from scholarships and bursaries to specialist teaching resources and facilities. Contributions of all sizes are welcome, and 100% of donations go directly to the chosen projects.To learn more or donate to the 2025 Annual Fund Related articles November 25, 2025 Sports Sophie Named Tayside’s Most Promising Tennis Junior Strathallan School pupil Sophie D was named Most Promising Junior at the Tennis Tayside Awards held in Dundee on Sunday.
