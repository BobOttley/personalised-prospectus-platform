The transformation, made possible through an exciting partnership with catering providers, Independents by Sodexo, is set to redefine student dining with a refreshed, dynamic experience.The new dining facility, named ‘Harry’s’ in honour of the school’s founder, Harry Riley, marks a new chapter in the way the school approaches dining on campus. The collaboration is aimed at creating a more sophisticated and contemporary dining environment, with versatile food offerings that cater to the diverse tastes and needs of both students and staff."I am thrilled with the results of this transformation project," said Angus Mackay, Strathallan’s Domestic Operations Manager and leader of the redevelopment project. "Harry’s is more than just a dining hall - it’s a vibrant, welcoming space that will bring our community together, enrich student life, and support our commitment to excellence in all aspects of education. Our brief was to deliver a space that felt like a high street offering and transport our pupils away from school life; I believe we have achieved this and am thankful to all those involved in the project for making this happen.”Head Chef Bruce Price prepping for school dinner.The completed space, which welcomed its first cohort of student diners yesterday, is already a hit with the Strathallan community.“I barely recognised it; it’s a completely different space!” said Strathallan School student Constantin B. He added, “It feels like a cool place to socialise with friends. It’s great to see this progress, not only the refurbishment but also the quality of food. It’s like eating at a cool restaurant.”Pupils enjoy their first lunch in Harry'sAs the school enters a new academic year, the team at ‘Harry’s’ will be working hard to deliver an innovative dining experience and provide high-quality meals in an inviting atmosphere. With the goal to create a dining experience that is as inspiring as it is delicious, the project promised to meet the needs of today’s students and set a new standard for school dining everywhere.
