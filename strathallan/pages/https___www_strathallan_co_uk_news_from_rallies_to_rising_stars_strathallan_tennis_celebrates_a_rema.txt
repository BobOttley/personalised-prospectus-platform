September marked a fantastic start as our U15 team clinched the U15 Scottish Schools Y9&10 Cup. Triumphing over the High School of Glasgow in the final, the formidable team of Freya C, Rosie E, Frankie W, and Sophie D brought the title back to Strathallan, last held in 2018. Our senior girls showcased their prowess over the winter, progressing to the LTA Youth Schools Regional Finals in March in Sunderland. Their exceptional performance culminated in winning the title. Congratulations to Freya C, Cecilia N, Katharina N, and Anni W for this impressive victory. The summer term continued the winning streak with our teams achieving a historic double: on May 30th, our girls secured the girls' Scottish Schools Championships, followed by the boys winning their Scottish Schools Championships a day later. This landmark achievement, the first time Strathallan has won national titles in these age groups, saw remarkable contributions from Alexander E, Jed McM, Ben C, Thomas D, Oskar V, Anni W, Katharina N, Lotti B, and Freya C. Inter-school competitions have been equally rewarding, with trophies from the Belhaven U13 Mixed Tournament, The Kilgraston Open, and The Loretto Mixed Doubles adorning our trophy cabinet. Additionally, Strathallan hosted four new tournaments, welcoming 190 players to our courts. Our teams have been vying for a place in the National Finals in Nottingham throughout the term. Our girls secured their spot after an outstanding regional qualifier final and a hard-fought win over Stonyhurst College. This week, Katharina N, Lotti B, Anni W, Freya C, and Cecilia N will face the UK's best schools, starting with the defending champions, Queenswood School. The girls are set to compete over four consecutive days to determine their final ranking in the UK. Individual successes have also shone brightly on court. A Strathallan pupil claimed their first International title at the ITF in Liverpool, marking a significant achievement for Alexander E. Freya C's victories in National singles and doubles titles add to our accolades. There have been notable selections for district, junior, and senior county teams, with outstanding performances at all levels within Scotland. Reflecting on this extraordinary year, Head of Tennis Tommy Ogilvie commented, "It has been a fantastic year. From my perspective, this group has been a joy to work with, demonstrating exceptional attitude and application throughout. Achieving the Scottish Schools titles for both boys and girls in the same year is a testament to their hard work and dedication. As our girls head to Nottingham for the National Schools Finals, we wish them every success."With the launch of the Tennis Academy, we look forward to continuing our progress and welcoming new pupils to join our Tennis Academy. Some spaces are available for those interested in taking their own game further. So don't hesitate to get in touch to be part of our thriving tennis community.
