Reflecting on his very first weightlifting competition, he said, "I enjoy how explosive it is and how explosive you have to be, and how you can vary up your training. The competition environment was incredible, everyone was cheering everyone else on." Kostas joined Strathallan School in September and began his weightlifting journey under coach Colin Hannah. His commitment sees him train twice a week with Mr Webb and Miss McKenzie in the School’s Strength and Conditioning Suite. His rapid progress reflects both his hard work and the School’s growing commitment to athletic development, recently strengthened by the launch of the Annual Fund, which aims to further expand access to game-changing sports performance opportunities.Originally from Livingston, Kostas was introduced to gym training by his father, who practices elite-level Taekwondo. Already training for rugby and judo, Kostas says he has loved the journey so far and is eager to keep progressing.Looking ahead, he hopes to compete at the Celtic Challenge next year, aiming to represent Scotland on an international stage.
