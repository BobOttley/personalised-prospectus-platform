Mr & Mrs McAuley Thornbank House is a family built not by chance, but by choice. A home where values come to life. Rooted in love, compassion, resilience, and acceptance, we are a community where every girl feels seen, supported, and safe to grow. We live by three simple, powerful choices: Choose kindness—in how we speak, act, and care for one another. Choose courage—to be ourselves, to face challenges, and to stand up for what’s right. Choose each other—because our House is built on showing up, reaching out, and growing together. Thornbank is the place to get involved! This could be at the in-House events such as Halloween, Christmas or Easter parties, one of our many BBQs, dancing at our 'silent disco' and our famous Binksie and Banksy Banquets! Our weekends are perfect for coming together across year groups to order takeout, play games, watch movies, bake, or just chat during the quieter moments. There are also many opportunities to represent the House and School in sport, art, music, performing arts, debating and academic endeavour. At Thornbank, we believe that strength is shared, differences are celebrated, and no one is left behind. Ohana!
